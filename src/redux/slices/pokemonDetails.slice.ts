/* Notes -  
Steps (in order of development): 
- setup slice
- defined type selectors
- setup service
- add service to store 
- then provide reduce store to rest of app (<Provider store = {store}>...)
- finally use typed hook (data, isLoading, or error and so on) states to manage UI behavior

Notes: 
- defining PayloadAction<> in the reducers eliminates the need to have a separate folder called actionCreators
    - the generated action creators will be correctly typed to accept a payload with the provided argument <T>
